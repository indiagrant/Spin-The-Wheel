# SpinTheWheel

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 20.0.2.

## Development server

To start the app locally:

```bash
ng serve
```

or

```bash
npm start
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

## Result Display Options

There are two ways to view the results after spinning the wheel:

1. Default (Navigation to Results Page)
   After the wheel finishes spinning, the application navigates to a separate /results page to display the outcome. This approach was implemented to meet initial requirements.

2. Optional (Dialog Window)
   For a smoother and (ever so slightly) more fun user experience, I have also built a dialog window component to view results.

## How to Switch Between Views

In shared/spinner/spinner.ts, modify the spinWheel() and spinToTargetSegment() methods:

To Use the Dialog View:
Uncomment the dialogService.openDialog(...) block.

Comment out the router.navigate(...) block.

To Use the Navigation View (Default):
Comment out the dialogService.openDialog(...) block.

Uncomment the router.navigate(...) block.

## Development Journey

This app was built iteratively, prioritising simplicity first and adding complexity gradually.

âœ… What Went Well
Component architecture: Broke down functionality into clean, reusable Angular standalone components using signals.

Iterative development: Started with a hardcoded version of the wheel to quickly validate concept. Gradually moved to a dynamic version with user-defined inputs and result handling.

ðŸ§© What Was Challenging
Calculating correct angles for dynamic segments took more debugging than expected - the best implementation of this was using HTML <canvas> element.

Spin mechanics: Both random and pre-determined spins work inconsistently â€” final segment landing logic needs refinement.

ðŸ“ˆ Ideas for Future Improvements
If I had more time, I would:

Add a maximum segment count and enforce a max character limit on labels for better layout consistency.

Introduce dynamic colour assignment to segments to improve visual distinction and clarity.

Debug and fix spin rotation calculations.
